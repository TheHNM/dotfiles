# thehnm's installation script

I created this script to replicate my current Arch Linux setup every time I move to another machine or when I have to reinstall my system. To avoid repeating the same tedious steps when
installing Arch Linux I wrote this script that takes over most of the steps.

The majority of this script was written by [Luke Smith](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz) in his Arch Linux installation script [LARBS](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS). All the
credits go to him. I only added some features not present in LARBS like hostname configuration or locale configuration.
